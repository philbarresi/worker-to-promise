# worker-to-promise
Because everyone wants a promise.

## The Goals

1. Make it easy to have a web worker perform some task and receive the result in the form of a promise
2. Make it easy to have a worker determine what work to do in a cleaner manner than a bunch of if statements
3. Make it easy to swap out from being worker based to other things, such as MQ based
